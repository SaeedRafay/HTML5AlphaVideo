# Interstitial HTML5 Video With Transparent Background

HTML5 does not have alpha support for videos. This package shows you how to use transparency in your video and use it as an interstitial intro on your webpage. It loads 1 second after all elements in your webpage are fully loaded.

## How To Do It?

1. Create your animation or video with no background in After Effects

2. Export a web friendly video (h264/mp4) with RGB channel

3. Export the same video again but this time with Alpha channel
